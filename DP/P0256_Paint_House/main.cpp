/**
 * 256. Paint House -- Easy
 * 
 * Micorsoft
 * 
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. 
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such 
 * that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 * 
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example,
 * costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 
 * with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 * 
 * Note:
 * All costs are positive integers
 * 
 * Example:
 *     Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]
 *     Output: 1
 *     Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue. 
Â             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
